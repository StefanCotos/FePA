    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <section id="Purpose">
      <h3>1.1 Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        We aim to launch a web application to monitor the behavior of stray or homeless animals, animals that pose a
        danger to humans and beyond. With this application it is easier to monitor some animals.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Conventions">
      <h3>1.2 Site Conventions</h3>
      <p>
        In creating the website, we used:
      </p>
      <p>
        Font: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif
      </p>
      <p>
        Colors: lightslategray, red, green, #9f917e, #fde8cd
      </p>
      <p>
        Libraries: firebase/php-jwt, cloudinary/cloudinary_php, vlucas/phpdotenv, phpmailer/phpmailer, laminas/laminas-feed
        , jsPDF to generate PDF, google charts to make charts, Open Street Map to display a map and others...
      </p>
      <p>
        We used the REST API architecture to make requests
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Audience">
      <h3>1.3 Intended Audience</h3>
      <p>
        Primarily young adults and adults, followed by a smaller percentage of children and the elderly.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Scope">
      <h3>1.4 Product Scope</h3>
      <p>
        Our aim is to provide assistance to people through this application, as animals can pose a significant danger if
        they are not properly treated or cared for. Before taking a stroll or heading to a particular area, people can
        check our application to see if there have been any recent reports in those areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our high-level goals are to:
      </p>
      <p>
        Making the website accessible worldwide.
        Reducing animal attacks on humans.
        Creating a space where animals and humans can coexist without disturbing each other.

      <h3>2.4 Operating Environment</h3>
      <p>
        Because it is a website, it will run on any device that can access a browser, regardless of the type of browser
        or its version. You can access it on any device that has internet access.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Design">
      <h3>2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>
      <p>
        One of the issues that may be encountered is that we rely on people worldwide to create reports, but they may
        create false or inaccurate reports, which can be challenges during development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another problem would be the
        need for strong security to ensure that no one can access data about other users.
